# Gmail Cleanup

Simple cleanup script to run that cleans your inbox based on a given query.

## Getting Started

- Go to script.google.com and copy this code in.
- Then open gmail and create the queries that work for finding everything you want to DELETE.
- Put those queries into the query array in the code.
- Adjust the date operation as needed. Note that it only appends a number and a letter to the query, so make sure you put your older_than or newer_than at the end.
- Run.
- ...
- Profit.

### Prerequisites

- Gmail
- Common sense

### Installing

- Clone this git.
