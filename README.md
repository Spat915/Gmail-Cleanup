# Gmail Cleanup

Simple cleanup script to run that cleans your inbox based on a given query.

## Getting Started

Go to script.google.com and copy this code in.
Then open gmail and create the queries that work for finding everything you want to DELETE.
Put those queries into the query array in the code.
Adjust the date operation as needed. Note that it only appends a number and a letter to the query, so make sure you put your older_than or newer_than at the end.
Run.
...
Profit.

### Prerequisites
